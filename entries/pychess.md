Graphical front-end that works with xboard-compatible engines such as GNU Chess and stockfish, and also comes with its own chess engine if no other is available.
PyChess is also capable of online play using the FICS server. Features include hints, different chess variants, and themeable chess pieces.

Now two projects? PyChess and PyChess-variants?
